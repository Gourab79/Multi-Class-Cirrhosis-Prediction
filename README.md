# Multi-Class-Cirrhosis-Prediction
Project Description: In this project, I applied various machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease. I used a dataset of 7905 patients with 20 features, such as age, sex, drug, bilirubin, cholesterol, albumin, copper, etc. I performed the following tasks:

Exploratory data analysis: I visualized the distribution and relationship of each feature with the target variable (status), which can be C (censored), CL (alive due to liver transplant), or D (deceased). I also plotted a heatmap to show the correlation among the features.
Data cleaning: I removed the outliers from the numerical features using the interquartile range method. I also transformed the categorical features into numerical values using label encoding.
Feature scaling: I normalized the numerical features by dividing them by their maximum values.
Model formation: I experimented with two models: logistic regression and decision tree classifier. I evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and log loss. I found that logistic regression had a higher accuracy of 80% than decision tree classifier, which had 73%. I also used a loop to run the model 100 times and plotted the score distribution.
Model interpretation: I generated a classification report to show the precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class. I also explained the meaning and importance of each metric in the context of the project.
This project demonstrated my skills and knowledge in data science, machine learning, and Python. It also showed my ability to solve a real-world problem using data and provide actionable insights.Project URL: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1No7bVicj0WL8VXY9o8WyTvGz8V8KNOba#scrollTo=9juAYiSCRB_- Project Description: In this project, I applied various machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease.
